This package has been manually patched to fix the loading error:

Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen - /usr/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby/../VERSION
  from /usr/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby/abstract_method.rb:5:in `read'

There is a hack used, the version is hardcoded instead of loading it from the VERSION file.

(In this case it would pollute the global /usr/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby directory,
to fix it properly we would need to move the file or fix the Debian packaging a bit...)


In case you need to update the package:

  # install the Debian tools to openSUSE
  zypper in dpkg

  # unpack the sources
  dpkg-source -x ruby-abstract-method_*.dsc

  # modify the sources
  vim ruby-abstract-method-*/...

  # commit the changes
  dpkg-source --commit ruby-abstract-method-*

  # update the source tarball
  dpkg-source -b ruby-abstract-method-*

  # then build and submit to OBS using "osc" as usually ...
